# android-blank
An empty Android repo which acts as a skeleton to try to out shiny new things or replicate bugs.

For anything to be tested and tried, can simply branch off from master to have an empty skeleton to try out feature or replicate the issue in an empty project (which is mostly always needed to file bug reports)

The master branch is updated when there are new library versions available.
